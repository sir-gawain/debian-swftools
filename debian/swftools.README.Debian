swftools for Debian
--------------------------

This version of swftools is compiled without the L.A.M.E support. The L.A.M.E
support in the original swftools is used to convert wave sound format into MPEG
1 audio layer 3 format for the SWF file.

There is an unofficial version of the swftools, which depends on the lame. The
unofficial version is called swftools-nonfree.
